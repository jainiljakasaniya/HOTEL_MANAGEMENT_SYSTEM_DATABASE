# Hotel Management System Database Project

This is a database design project for a hotel management system. The system aims to automate various hotel operations such as front office, booking and reservation, inventory management, quality management, security, housekeeping, and customer relationship management (CRM). The project focuses on designing a robust and efficient database to support these operations.

## Project Details

### Hotel Chain and Hotel Hierarchy

A hotel can be part of a hotel chain, which may consist of multiple hotels. Each hotel is uniquely identified by its name and is associated with a hotel chain. The project should handle the relationship between hotels and hotel chains.

### Room and Floor Management

Each hotel consists of multiple floors, and each floor can have multiple rooms. Rooms can be of different types, with each type having a different price and description. The system should support the management of rooms, including their availability, types, and related information.

### Employee and Customer Management

Hotels employ several employees to provide services to customers. The system should maintain employee records and their respective roles within the hotel. Additionally, the system should handle customer management, including guest records, customer identities, addresses, check-in and check-out times, and other relevant information.

### Hotel Information

The system should store detailed information about each hotel, including the following:

- Countries where the hotels are located.
- Hotel chain name.
- Hotel name.
- Hotel URL.
- Hotel characteristics (description).
- Each hotel should have one and only one star rating, and each star rating should have an associated image.
- Each hotel should have a room capacity and a floor count.
- Each hotel should have a unique address.

### Booking and Reservation

The system should support the tracking of guest bookings and reservations. The following requirements should be considered:

- Tracking guests based on their names, addresses, and cities.
- Tracking bookings based on dates, booking types, and room counts.
- Designating room types with standard rates, room descriptions, and smoking allowance.
- Defining room rate periods to offer discounts during specific times of the year (e.g., Jan to March, July to Aug, Sept to Dec).

## Queries

The system should be capable of answering the following queries:

1. How many distinct guests have made bookings for a particular month?
2. How many available rooms are there in a particular hotel for a given date?
3. How many hotels are in a hotel chain?
4. How many bookings has a customer made in one year?
5. How many rooms are booked in a particular hotel on a given date?
6. List all the unique countries where hotels are located.
7. How many rooms are available in a given hotel?
8. List all the hotels that have a URL available.
9. List the rate for a room at a given time during the year.
